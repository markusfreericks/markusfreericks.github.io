Together with [Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/), he was involved in creating a small web site you might have heard about: [stack overflow](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2008/09/15/stack-overflow-launches/).

- [mjd](https://blog.plover.com/) blogs about mathematics, programming, language, history, and other interesting things. I first followed his blog because he was an active perl developer, and for maybe 10 years, i had wrote lots of perl - the first web age was stiched together with cgi-bin scripts, mostly written in perl.

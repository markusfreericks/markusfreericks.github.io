## People who have interesting sites

In the first decades of the WWW, homepages were the place where people published their writings. These evolved into blogs, and some old-timers still maintain these. If you are interested in basic software engineering, you could do worse than peruse these.

- [Tom Van Vleck's](https://www.multicians.org/thvv/) [Multics](https://www.multicians.org/) site. Multics was a big operating system project, and indirect name giver for UNIX. The site links to people who worked on Multics, and contains lots of papers, articles, and anecdotes. I regularly preach the [Three Questions About Each Bug You Find](https://www.multicians.org/thvv/threeq.html) to young developers.

- [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/) was really active in the software blogging world in the [early 2000s](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/archives/). Together with [Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/), he was involved in creating a small web site you might have heard about: [stack overflow](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2008/09/15/stack-overflow-launches/). These days, he works at [HASH](https://hash.ai/)

- [Folklore](https://www.folklore.org/0-index.html) contains stories about the original Macintosh project. Contains the [-2000 lines of code](https://www.folklore.org/Negative_2000_Lines_Of_Code.html) story.

- [Diomidis Spinellis](https://www.spinellis.gr/) is a professor for software engineering, writes good articles about themes like code quality and debugging, and maintains a [blog](https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/contents.html)

- [mjd](https://blog.plover.com/) blogs about mathematics, programming, language, history, and other interesting things. I first followed his blog because he was an active perl developer, and for maybe 10 years, i had wrote lots of perl - the first web age was stiched together with cgi-bin scripts, mostly written in perl.

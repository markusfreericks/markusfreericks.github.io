## Persons of interest 

### Historic

- [Tom Van Vleck's](https://www.multicians.org/thvv/) [Multics](https://www.multicians.org/) site. Multics was a big operating system project, and indirect name giver for UNIX. The site links to people who worked on Multics, and contains lots of papers, articles, and anecdotes. 
-- I regularly preach the [Three Questions About Each Bug You Find](https://www.multicians.org/thvv/threeq.html) to young developers.

- [Rob Pike](http://herpolhode.com/rob/) [on github](https://github.com/robpike), one of the fathers of Unix (and plan 9, and go)
-- [2001 Presentation The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: The Unix Legacy](http://herpolhode.com/rob/ugly.pdf)
-- he sometimes writes articles on the [go blog](https://go.dev/blog/all)

- [Folklore](https://www.folklore.org/0-index.html) contains stories about the original Macintosh project and the people who worked there
-- the [-2000 lines of code](https://www.folklore.org/Negative_2000_Lines_Of_Code.html) story

- [Donald E. Knuth](https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/) still lives, and works on [the art of computer programming](https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html)
-- latest news: The first third of Volume 4C is here (the classic taocp that i have at home has 3 volumes; "Volume" 4 is about Combinatorial Algorithms and will be released in parts, since it would be too big for one printed book - 4A has 883 pages, 4B 736, 4C only 640)

- the [Turing Award Clips](https://www.youtube.com/@TuringAwardeeClips/videos)

- [Diomidis Spinellis](https://www.spinellis.gr/) is a professor for software engineering, writes good articles about themes like code quality and debugging, and maintains a [blog](https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/contents.html)

- [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/) was really active in the software blogging world in the [early 2000s](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/archives/). Together with [Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/), he was involved in creating a small web site you might have heard about: [stack overflow](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2008/09/15/stack-overflow-launches/). These days, he works at [HASH](https://hash.ai/)

- [Steve Yegge](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/), while at amazon, used to write the (to me) amusing [Stevey's Drunken Blog Rants™](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/blog-rants).

- [mjd](https://blog.plover.com/) blogs about mathematics, programming, language, history, and other interesting things. I first followed his blog because he was an active perl developer, and for maybe 10 years, i had wrote lots of perl - the first web age was stiched together with cgi-bin scripts, mostly written in perl.

- [Dave Winer's Scripting News](http://scripting.com/) is still a thing!

- the [perl blogs](https://blogs.perl.org/). yes, perl still exists, and it is still perl 5.

### Current

- [Casey Muratori](https://caseymuratori.com/) cares about efficiency/performance. he has a gaming engine background.
-- he participated in a set of vidoes about how to approach the [One Billion Row Challeng](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc) [in java](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-YK3B4_xPA) (see also [Roy van Rijn's presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFXxXFHpS0M&t=2082s))
-- [nice talk of his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo84LFzx5nI) where he goes down the rabbit hole of virtual function and class representation in C++, Simula, and ends up with tagged records in Tony Hoare's 1966 record paper. "Team Fat Struct - Founded 1960".

- [Gunnar Morling](https://www.morling.dev/) [blog](https://www.morling.dev/blog/) initiated 1BRC. maybe next year he will do a new benchmark challenge?
-- he also started MapStruct and worked on Bean Validation

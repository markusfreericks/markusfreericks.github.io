attributed to "a certain chinese encyclopedia" in: The Analytical Language of John Wilkins, a short essay by J. L. Borges. It is not entirely clear whether such an encyclopaedia really did exist, or, if not, it was dreamt up by Borges, the guy he quotes, or somewhone else entirely. The term "chinese encyclopedia" has been used as a synonym for "a motley collection of things" or "a failed attempt at systematization" by many people.

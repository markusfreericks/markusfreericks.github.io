# homepage

in the good old days, i had a homepage. you could find it on www.cs.tu-berlin.de/~mfx. somewhere in 1995, it was abandoned; for a while, a copy could be found at uni bielefeld. after that, the last snapshot was on mfx.dasburo.com (which is now also defunct).

at the time (1994? the very first widely avaiable browser, NCSA Mosaic, had just come out - i was browser the meager web on a monochrome sparcstation (elc? slc?)) everyone at our department was doing homepages, to present themselves, their work, and link lists -- a "home page" was the start page of your browser then, and there were no bookmarks within the browser then.

so here is my new attempt at preservation of ancient history.

### what to find here, eventually

(this is currently a to-do list. i am writing this in december 2025, since i have a few vacation days. no idea how much energy i can find to finish this)

- my annotated list of publications (sorry, nothing new since i did my PhD work)
- maybe a bit about nML (strangely enough my only lasting legacy to computer science)
- some musings about ALDiSP (the language i never really finished the compiler for)
- *no* copy of my old "trash heap" link list (99% of which would point to nothing), or the old DHTML experiments (which would not work under modern browsers), or my rants (which have not been relevant for 20 years)
- maybe a reading list?
- maybe the old people list, updated?

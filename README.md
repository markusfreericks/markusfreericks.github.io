# homepage

in the good old days, i had a homepage. you could find it on www.cs.tu-berlin.de/~mfx. somewhere in 1995, it was abandoned; for a while, a copy could be found at uni bielefeld. after that, the last snapshot was on mfx.dasburo.com (which is now also defunct).

so here is my new attempt at preservation of ancient history.

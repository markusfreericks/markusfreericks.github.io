### about me

- Dr. Markus Freericks
- married to the brilliant [Sarai Cole Freericks](https://www.saraicole.com/)
- studied at TU Berlin, 1985-1990 (finished as "Diplom-Informatiker")
- in that time, i participated in a computer music project (CAMP), an environment in which I did my Vordiplom work: a real-time Scheme implemenation based on an existing Forth interpreter (FORMULA, Forth Music Language) with an embedded cooperative multithreading realtime support
- worked at my PhD at TU Berlin, 1990-1993, financed by an Ernst-von-Siemens stipend, in the context of an EU project ("Cathedral") in which we worked on a compiler-compiler in the telecom/signal processing domain
- in that project, i came up with the nML machine description language. wrote some papers about that, coached students writing tools (e.g. instruction set simulators) for it
- the thesis was about a compiler for ALDiSP, the attempt to define a functional language that could support real-time events, bz adding a new control construct (the "suspension") which was kind of the opposite of a "delay" - while delay implements call-by-need in an eager language, suspend implements an input/preconditions-driven evaluation
- the idea for the compiler was to use abstract interpretation/partial evaluation to come up with a static schedule for the program
- finalized my PhD thesis and got my Dr.-Ing. at Uni Bielefeld in 1997 (while i was already working at Büro am Draht)
- did university projects in C, C++, Prolog, Scheme, SML
- did commercial projects in C, C++, and Perl (one of the perl projects was the page generator for a german news website - we were proud to be one of the few sites that could stand the [load](https://web.archive.org/web/20010913095659/http://www.n-tv.de/) when 9/11 happened)
- wrote and maintained some Java projects, one of which in one or another form is still running at a big german automative company (the oldest code commit that in that project is from 2005)
- did front-end, back-end, architecture, optimizations, a bit of devops, internal coaching, ...
